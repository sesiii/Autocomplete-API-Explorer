# Autocomplete API Explorer

## Overview
This project aims to explore and extract all names from an undocumented autocomplete API at `http://35.200.185.69:8000`. The goal is to discover its behavior, handle constraints, and document findings.

## Setup
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: `requests` (`pip install requests`)

## Plan
1. Test the known endpoint: `/v1/autocomplete?query=<string>`.
2. Explore API behavior and constraints.
3. Build an extraction script.
4. Document discoveries.
